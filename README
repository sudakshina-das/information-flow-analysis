To build gcc-4.7.2 refer to the following instructions

Step I : Downloading the gcc source code tarball

    Make a new folder 'ifa', and cd to it
         ~/$. mkdir ifa
         ~/$. cd ifa
    Download gcc-4.7.2 tarball in this folder.
    Untar the gcc-4.7.2 tarball
         ~/lfcpa$. tar -xvf gcc-4.7.2-tar.gz
    After untarring, you will see a folder 'gcc-4.7.2'
    Make the 'build' and 'install' directories.
         ~/ifa$. mkdir build
         ~/ifa$. mkdir install

Step II : Building GCC 4.7.2

    Let us assume that $INSTALL is the absolute path of install directory, and $SRC is the absolute path of gcc-4.7.2 directory.
    cd to the build directory.
         ~/ifa$. cd build
    Configure gcc-4.7.2. For example, if we wish to build a C compiler, type the following to configure gcc.
         ~/ifa/build$. $SRC/configure --enable-languages=c --prefix=$INSTALL
    If you are on a 64 bit system, disable multilib during configure by the option --disable-multilib
    After configuring successfully, build gcc-4.7.2.
         ~/ifa/build$. make
    If a successful make, install the gcc binaries in the install directory.
         ~/ifa/build$. make install

Now use the pristine gcc-4.7.2 build for the ifa plugin by following the steps below:

Step I : Building the plugin

    This folder currently contains the plugin files and a Makefile
    Make changes in the Makefile
         ~/ifa-plugin-v2$. vi Makefile
    Modify the value of BASE_DIR with the path to the base directory of your pristine gcc-4.7.2 build
    Hook the plugin dynamically in gcc
         ~/ifa-plugin-v2$. make
    You will see a file named plugin.so after the successful make.

Step II : Testing L-FCPA

    Create any sample program that you may want to test. Our test files are given in the folders /benchmark and /bench_pre.
    Modify the Makefile to reflect the input file names by changing the target of the "test" as indicated in the Makefile
    Run the command
         ~/ifa-plugin-v2$. make test
    Inspect the generated ifa dump *.233i.ifa where * is the name of the test file to analyze the information gathered by the pass.
    Use the following to delete all dump files
         ~/ifa-plugin-v2$. make clean
